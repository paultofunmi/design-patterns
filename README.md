## Design Patterns
Software design pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem.

### Design Patterns Covered
- Strategy (B): allows you pick algorithms (approaches) at runtime
- Iterator (B): lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree etc)
- Builder (C): Allows creation of complex objects in step-wise formats
- Singleton (C): Allows and guarantees a single instance of a class
- Adapter (S): Allows you to create a bridge between incompatible classes. Makes existing classes work with new ones without touching old codebase.
